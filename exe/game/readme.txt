here is a 2d physics engine that I wrote. 
the little robot can jet around, jump multiple times, and throw a ball.
he is controlled by the arrow keys or wasd.
I don't have ipad controls for his motion yet, but you can throw the ball by tapping the screen, or clicking the mouse or stylus. 

my goal was to get the jumping and movements to feel really satisfying. 
I also put a lot of time into the trail looking nice.

here are the full keyboard controls:
reccomended to use keyboard and mouse!

controls:
wasd/arrows: move
mouse: throw ball
[ : shorter trail
] : longer trail
- : thinner trail
= : wider trail
. : display physics
h : toggle platforms/floor
g : toggle sprite visibility


It was a difficult challenge to get everything feeling smooth.
There is still room to grow here in terms of a feeling of solidity.

Mario survived, while so many of his contemporaries were forgotten, primarilly because the JUMP felt so clean. A program should always strive to feel satisfying to use.
