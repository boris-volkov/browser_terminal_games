Here is a logic puzzle that I found in a book and decided to write a program around. You start by learning the rules to a particular number game, and then attempt to pass the SIX TESTS. You play by just typing your answers into the interactive terminal. There is no penalty for wrong guesses. 

This puzzle is rather hard, so be prepared to take a few hours, at least.
