When you're learning how to draw, one important skill is drawing straight lines. It means you have a strong control. 

This is a training program to practice drawing straight lines on a tablet. 
For every line you draw, it overlays the line you were most probably trying to draw (if there even was one), and scores your line on a scale of 0-100. It also keeps an ongoing average. You can clear the drawing pad with the button on the bottom, or refresh your browser to reset the scores.

Try drawing sun rays out from the center, aiming to maintain straight lines in every direction.
