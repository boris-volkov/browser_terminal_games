Here is an arithmetic drilling program. It gives you five minutes to do as many arithmetic operations as you can in five minutes, cycling through the four major operations. You get more points for answering quickly, but the more points you have, the harder the questions get. You get a score at the end, which you can use to gauge your own progress across time.

You'll be surprised how quick your mind can get with practice...

Study the code and see how it is built. Missing is the code for the terminal interface "xterm.js" which is available on github. It is just the interface to print characters to the screen; all the game logic is here.
