Here is a simple square that displays any color you ask it to. You can change its color by holding any of the [r], [g], or [b] buttons for red, green, and blue, and using the up and down arrows to adjust the amounts. 
for example: 
holding r and pressing the up arrow will raise the red value by 1. Hold the keys to make the change more rapid.

See how different combinations of red green and blue will look on the screen.

They are all set to start at the neutral level of 125, which is in the middle of the allowed range of [0,255]. All colors set to neutral creates a neutral gray. As the level of a color increases above the others, that color begins to stand out. There are over 16 million colors you can make this way (256^3).

Try to find your favorite color in the magical rectangle!

For advanced practice: if you look through the javascript, you will see some unused functionality. Adding controls for this functionality will let you create full spectrum color gradients.
