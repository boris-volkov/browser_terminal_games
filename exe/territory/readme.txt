This two-player game is based on Go and Othello and Snake and Tron- You have to claim as many spots on the board as possible by moving a light around a grid, claiming the spots you walk over and the spots you surround. 

The pink and blue player take turns moving their lights, and the game can be played on a single keyboard, or on two.

pink is operated by

	[←][↓][→]

and blue is operated by

    [a][s][d]


As you move, you light up the path you travel in your color.
You also light up squares that you have completely surrounded,
even if the other player has already colored them.
Each step moves you two squares.
You can jump OVER the other player's color, but not ONTO.
That is another way to steal a square.

Whoever lights up more squares by the end wins.

When does the game end?
Like in Go, players have to agree that the game is finished,
and nobody can get any more squares.

Things to pay attention to in the code:
There is a "locking" animation that takes place whenever a player is moving. See if you can find in the code how the lock is implemented.
