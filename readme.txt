This page is meant to display code in an aesthetic way. 

Each language has its own color scheme, and features syntax hilighting.
The color scheme is controlled by the css, 
and the syntax hilighting is done via a python parser program that puts in html tags. 
With this program I can quickly generate new pages out of any code that I have. 

The full code for this page is shown below, some parts of it may be a little messy,
but overall, it works. There is also code for the terminal interface to this page, 
which is a very good example of spaghetti code!

Slowly read the code and try to see what it does on the actual webpage you're on.
Sorry if it's complicated! If you find any mistakes in the code please let me know!
