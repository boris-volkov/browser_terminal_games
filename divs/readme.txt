Try to understand how the html leads to the picture you see on the screen. It is all just empty divs nested in each other, and we can achieve a multitude of layout patterns. Study this example closely, and modify it to make your own picture!

This is only structure, without "content". All of the divs are empty, yet it is their organization relative to each other that creates a content of itself. content grows out of emptiness through the nesting structure.
