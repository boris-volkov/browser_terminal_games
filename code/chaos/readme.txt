Take your time to understand this python program...

It generates one of the most interesting graphs in all of math. At certain points it is predictable, at others, it is quite "random". It is actually very hard to create a function that outputs random numbers on a computer, since computer programs are essentially deterministic. 

This program uses the python module matplotlib a.k.a. "math plot library" to draw the graph. It's the python graphing calculator. You may need to download this module.
