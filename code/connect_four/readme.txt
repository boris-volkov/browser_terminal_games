Here is a command-line program in python3 that lets you play a connect four game in the terminal. 
Players take turns entering the column they would like to drop thier piece into.
Play progresses until one player connects a line of 4 pieces, diagonals count.

The program uses an internal colors module in order to print colored unicode characters for the game grid.
If you make your terminal full screen and enlarge the font by a lot, then it starts to look like a real game!
See the screenshot above for reference...

This program uses some fairly advanced grid iteration techniques that made my head spin even when I was writing this program. There are likely better ways to do the checking for lines of 4, and if so, I welcome you to try them!

Since this program uses unicode, it may not run in all online python editors. The best way to try this program is to run it locally in your own python interpreter.
