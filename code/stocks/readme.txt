To be honest, I wrote this game while in some argument with my brother. I wrote it to try to prove a point to him, which, if you have siblings, you know is a good motivating factor. I'm not sure if I ever proved my point, or what my point even was, but playing this game ended up being pretty fun, and a few people have enjoyed it. 

It puts you into a comically simplified stock trading situation, where you have the stock of a single company available to you, and you start off with a bank of $10,000 dollars to spend. The price of that stock has an equal change of going up as it does of going down. 

Your goal as a player is to try to make money by "buying low and selling high" while having to pay rent every month!
The final goal is to see how much money you can earn in one year. At the end of the year, the computer will tell you how much money it was possible to have made making the optimal decisions. 

controls: 

b : buy
s : sell
enter: enter (or skip if nothing to enter)
numbers: numbers

note: you need your own python interpreter to run this. This is one of the disadvantages of python compared to javascript, in my opinion, and I plan to rewrite this in javascript so that I can make it more easily available online.
