Here is a small collection of sample Python turtle programs for example and inspiration.
Note: some of these have a rather large screen size, so you may need to scroll around to see what is going on.

You need a Python interpreter set up on your computer to run these.
It can be downloaded for free from www.python.org

These programs can either be copy-pasted into the interactive interpreter,
or saved into a plain-text file with the extension .py, for example:

hex_spiral.py (note the underscore to separate words!)

you can then edit the code in your favorite text editor, and run it from a terminal (or power shell on windows) with the line:

python3 hex_spiral.py

You can of course also run them from an IDE if you have one set up.
