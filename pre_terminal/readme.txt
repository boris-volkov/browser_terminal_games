Python programmers going into javascript miss the simplicity of console input/output using the input() function. This script sets up a command-line environment right in the browser, and can be used with your text input/output programs. 

The code below has the interface, as well as a sample multiplication training program to show you how to use it. 

Commands in this terminal are prefaced with a dot, so .ls will show a command listing, .clear clears the terminal, and .times runs the multiplication program. 

advanced practice:
write your own input/output program that uses this interface. This can be a quiz or a chat bot or anything you like.
