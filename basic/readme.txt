This (almost) blank webpage is to show you how to begin (almost) any html project. 

The html file below contains the crucial elements, and a single div in the body. 
It has a link to a stylesheet which should be in the same directory, and here has the name "style.css". 

Anything else that you would like to have on your page, text, images, videos, etc, ought to be in this directory or a sub-directory.
